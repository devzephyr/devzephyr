**Welcome to devzephyr**

I'm Adeyemi Folarin, a cybersecurity student with a passion for all things offensive security. This website
is my playground, where I'll share my adventures in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and other security-related
endeavors.

**What you can expect here:**

* CTF walkthroughs: Detailed solutions to popular CTF challenges, complete with code snippets and explanations.
* Security tutorials: Step-by-step guides on various topics, from exploiting vulnerabilities to evading detection.
* Personal anecdotes: Stories of my own experiences in the world of cybersecurity, including successes, failures,
and lessons learned.

**Why I'm doing this:**

I believe that sharing knowledge is key to advancing our field. By documenting my journey through CTFs and other
security challenges, I hope to inspire others to explore these topics and learn from my mistakes.

**How you can help me:**

* Report errors or provide feedback on the walkthroughs.
* Share your own CTF solutions in the comments.
* Contribute to the development of new content (if you're interested in writing tutorials, let me know!).
